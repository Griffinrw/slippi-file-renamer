# Slippi File Renamer

Easily renames Super Smash Bros Melee replay files.

## Description

Have a replay file from Super Smash Bros Melee but don't like the default file name?

Use my program to edit the filenames to be more descriptive!

It will list the characters' names, your opponent, as well as the stage you played on. Works on individual files or batches. Complete with a .exe file and easy-to-use GUI.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Windows

### Installing

* Download .exe file
* You may need to allow windows permission to "trust" the .exe manually

### Executing program

* Run the .exe
* Select the directory path of the slippi files you want to edit
* Press "ok" and it will start running

## Help

You may need to manually allow windows to accept the .exe from this source
